This python script works entirely from running the script, and utilizes the Turtle module to draw a binary (in most cases) tree. The number of iterations of the tree can be customised.

Many features of the tree are randomised, such as early termination of the branch one iteration before the given n iterations, the angle of the branch in proportion to the contect of the angle of the new branches parent, and the length of the branch.
